## 2. Project Description
Virtual Fridge is a smart companion for your kitchen, designed to help you stay organized, reduce food waste, and make healthier choices. By scanning barcodes, the app automatically tracks what products you've bought and keeps an up-to-date inventory of what's in your fridge. It sends timely notifications when items are nearing their expiration date, ensuring you use them before they go bad.

Beyond just tracking, Virtual Fridge helps you get the most out of your groceries. It suggests recipes based on the ingredients you already have, helping you save money while minimizing waste. You can also view detailed nutritional information for the foods in your fridge, making it easier to plan balanced meals. With Virtual Fridge, your kitchen becomes smarter, your meals more creative, and your lifestyle more sustainable.

## 3. Requirements Specification

### **3.1. List of Features**
1. **Authentication**: To access the app, users must complete a Google authentication process. A user must create an account with our app through their Google account. Users can sign out and delete their accounts, but cannot sign up multiple times with the same Google account

2. **Log Food**: The user can add their food to the app by scanning the aforementioned food. If the food has a barcode, the user can click a button on the home page to bring up a barcode scanner used to get the information from the food. Without a barcode, the user can take a picture of the item to log. If that logging fails, or gives an item that is incorrect, the user can select from a pre-made list. 

3. **View Fridge**: The user can see a home page listing all the scanned items. They are able to sort the food by different metrics, such as by expiration date, added date or by nutritional values. 

4. **Get Recipes**: The user can find recipes using one or more ingredients in their virtual fridge. After selecting the items on the home screen, the user can ask for recipes, in which they will receive a small list of recipe overviews which can be clicked on for more details surrounding more ingredients needed and cooking instructions. Generate recipes automatically with items in the fridge for the user to select if the user does not select any item.

5. **Get Nutrition**: The user can click on any item in their fridge and get the nutritional value for said item. There will be a new screen that appears showing nutritional facts such as calories, fat, carbs and protein.

6. **Expiry Notification**: Send notification to the user to alert them for expiring items. The user can configure the timing to get a notification when their food begins to expire. For example, the user could ask for 48 hours notice, giving them a notification 48 hours before any of the food in their fridge expires.

### **3.2. Use Case Diagram**
![](images/usecase.svg)

### **3.3. Actors Description**
1. **Users**: The users of the virtual fridge application are individuals and households who want to manage their food inventory more efficiently. They rely on the app to keep track of what items are currently in their fridge or pantry, monitor expiration dates, reduce food waste, and plan meals based on available ingredients. Users may include busy professionals, students, families, or anyone looking for convenience, organization, and cost savings in their daily food management.

2. **Barcode Scanner**: A module that scans a barcode and retrieves the ID of the associated product.

3. **The MealDB API**: An API that returns structured recipe data based on passed in parameters like ingredients.

4. **Open Food Facts API**: An API that returns nutritional data, images, product name, ingredients, and product ID based on passed in parameters.

5. **Google Authentication**: The authentication module provided by Google. This handles Users logging in or otherwise managing their profile using their Google account.

6. **Gemini API**: An API offered by google to make requests to the Gemini LLM.

### **3.7. Non-Functional Requirements**

<a name="nfr1"></a>
1. **Barcode Scanning Response Time**
  - **Description**: The barcode scanning feature must process and return results within 5 seconds.
  - **Justification**: According to a study on mobile 1D barcode scanners, "feedback and performance of a read must not exceed five seconds." This guideline ensures that users receive timely feedback, enhancing the overall user experience. [cocoa.ethz.ch](https://cocoa.ethz.ch/downloads/2014/06/None_AUTOIDLAB-WP-SWNET-029.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

<a name="nfr2"></a>
2. **Image Recognition Accuracy**
  - **Description**: The image recognition feature should achieve at least a 95% accuracy rate in identifying food items.
  - **Justification**: Users will be displeased if the OCR consistently makes mistakes when logging produce. The standard acceptance is around 95-97%. A well-implemented solution typically delivers 95-97% accuracy” [softservebs](http://softservebs.com/en/resources/ai-product-recognition/)

<a name="nfr3"></a>
3. **Mobile App Load Time**
**Description**: The application should load and become interactive within 2.5 seconds of launch.
**Justification**: Studies indicate that a large portion of visitors will leave if an application takes too long to load. “Statistics indicate that 40% of visitors will leave a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.” [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-fast-should-a-website-load)
