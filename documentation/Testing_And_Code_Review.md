## 3. Back-end Test Specification: Tests of Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Test Locations in Git

| **Non-Functional Requirement**  | **Location in Git**                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Performance (Response Time)** | [`tests/nonfunctional/response_time.test.js`](#) |
| **Chat Data Security**          | [`tests/nonfunctional/chat_security.test.js`](#) |

### 3.2. Test Verification and Logs

- **Performance (Response Time)**

  - **Verification:** This test suite simulates multiple concurrent API calls using Jest along with a load-testing utility to mimic real-world user behavior. The focus is on key endpoints such as user login and study group search to ensure that each call completes within the target response time of 2 seconds under normal load. The test logs capture metrics such as average response time, maximum response time, and error rates. These logs are then analyzed to identify any performance bottlenecks, ensuring the system can handle expected traffic without degradation in user experience.

## 4. Front-end Test Specification

### 4.1. Location in Git of Front-end Test Suite:

`frontend/src/androidTest/java/com/studygroupfinder/`

### 4.2. Tests

- **Use Case: Login**

  - **Expected Behaviors:**
    | **Scenario Steps** | **Test Case Steps** |
    | ------------------ | ------------------- |
    | 1. The user opens "Add Todo Items" screen. | Open "Add Todo Items" screen. |
    | 2. The app shows an input text field and an "Add" button. The add button is disabled. | Check that the text field is present on screen.<br>Check that the button labelled "Add" is present on screen.<br>Check that the "Add" button is disabled. |
    | 3a. The user inputs an ill-formatted string. | Input "_^_^^OQ#$" in the text field. |
    | 3a1. The app displays an error message prompting the user for the expected format. | Check that a dialog is opened with the text: "Please use only alphanumeric characters ". |
    | 3. The user inputs a new item for the list and the add button becomes enabled. | Input "buy milk" in the text field.<br>Check that the button labelled "add" is enabled. |
    | 4. The user presses the "Add" button. | Click the button labelled "add ". |
    | 5. The screen refreshes and the new item is at the bottom of the todo list. | Check that a text box with the text "buy milk" is present on screen.<br>Input "buy chocolate" in the text field.<br>Click the button labelled "add".<br>Check that two text boxes are present on the screen with "buy milk" on top and "buy chocolate" at the bottom. |
    | 5a. The list exceeds the maximum todo-list size. | Repeat steps 3 to 5 ten times.<br>Check that a dialog is opened with the text: "You have too many items, try completing one first". |
