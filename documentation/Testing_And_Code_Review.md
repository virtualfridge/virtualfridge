## 3. Test Specification: Tests of Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Test Locations in Git

| **Non-Functional Requirement**  | **Location in Git**                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Time to Full Display (TTFD) Benchmark**          | [`frontend/macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/TtfdStartupBenchmark.kt`](../frontend/macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/TtfdStartupBenchmark.kt) |
| **Barcode Lookup Benchmark** | [`frontend/macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/BarcodeLookupBenchmark.kt`](../frontend/macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/BarcodeLookupBenchmark.kt) |

### 3.2. Test Verification and Logs

- **Time to Full Display (TTFD) Benchmark**

  - **Verification:** This test simulates a user starting the app multiple times from a cold boot state. The test launches and quits the app repeatedly over 10 iterations, where the minimum, median, and max time is calculated between the startup intent to the time to fully display the app.
  - **Log Output**
  Below is what the expected output should be, where you can see the minimum, median, and max loading time from the iterations in milliseconds.

- **Barcode Lookup Benchmark**
  - **Verification:** This test simulates a user logging into the app and sending a barcode API request. It is done over 10 iterations, where the minimum, median, and max time are displayed in milliseconds. The minimum, median, and max time is calculated between the moment the test barcode button is clicked to the time to receive the API call back.
  - **Log Output**
Below is what the expected output should be, where you can see the minimum, median, and max loading time from the iterations in milliseconds.

- **Running the Tests:** To runs the tests, open the `frontend` folder as a project in Android Studio. Running the app normally and ensure that only one Google account is logged into the phone. Then select the appropriate test (see screenshot below).

## 4. Front-end Test Specification

### 4.1. Location in Git of Front-end Test Suite:

`frontend/src/androidTest/java/com/studygroupfinder/`

### 4.2. Tests

- **Use Case: Login**

  - **Expected Behaviors:**
    | **Scenario Steps** | **Test Case Steps** |
    | ------------------ | ------------------- |
    | 1. The user opens "Add Todo Items" screen. | Open "Add Todo Items" screen. |
    | 2. The app shows an input text field and an "Add" button. The add button is disabled. | Check that the text field is present on screen.<br>Check that the button labelled "Add" is present on screen.<br>Check that the "Add" button is disabled. |
    | 3a. The user inputs an ill-formatted string. | Input "_^_^^OQ#$" in the text field. |
    | 3a1. The app displays an error message prompting the user for the expected format. | Check that a dialog is opened with the text: "Please use only alphanumeric characters ". |
    | 3. The user inputs a new item for the list and the add button becomes enabled. | Input "buy milk" in the text field.<br>Check that the button labelled "add" is enabled. |
    | 4. The user presses the "Add" button. | Click the button labelled "add ". |
    | 5. The screen refreshes and the new item is at the bottom of the todo list. | Check that a text box with the text "buy milk" is present on screen.<br>Input "buy chocolate" in the text field.<br>Click the button labelled "add".<br>Check that two text boxes are present on the screen with "buy milk" on top and "buy chocolate" at the bottom. |
    | 5a. The list exceeds the maximum todo-list size. | Repeat steps 3 to 5 ten times.<br>Check that a dialog is opened with the text: "You have too many items, try completing one first". |
